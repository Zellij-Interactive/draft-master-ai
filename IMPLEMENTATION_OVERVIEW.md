# Implementation Overview: Enhanced Welcome Page & Patch Videos (English Only)

This document explains how the new welcome experience and always-English Patch Videos feature are implemented in your LoL Pre-Game Analysis app.

---

## 1. Enhanced Welcome Page Rendering

- **File:** `components/enhanced_welcome.py`
- **Entry Point:** The function `render_enhanced_welcome()`
- **What it does:**
  - Displays a modern welcome screen with:
    - Latest patch analysis (AI-powered if Gemini API key is set, fallback otherwise)
    - Featured patch videos
    - Trending champions by role
    - Analysis features grid
- **How it's shown:**
  - In `app.py`, if the user has not yet performed an analysis (`analysis_performed` is `False`), `render_enhanced_welcome()` is called instead of the old static welcome HTML.

## 2. Patch Videos: Always-English Descriptions

- **File:** `utils/gemini_api.py` (`VideoContentFetcher` class)
- **How videos are fetched:**
  - If a YouTube API key is set, `_fetch_youtube_videos()` uses the YouTube Data API to search for patch-related videos.
  - The API call includes `relevanceLanguage="en"` to prefer English results.
- **How English is guaranteed:**
  - Each video description is passed to a helper function `translate_to_english()` if a Gemini API key is available.
  - This function uses the Gemini model to translate the description to English, regardless of the original language.
  - The translated (or original) description is then shown in the UI.

## 3. Gemini-Powered Translation Logic

- **Translation function:**
  - For every video, the description is sent to Gemini with a prompt: `Translate this text to English (output only the translation, no commentary): ...`
  - The Gemini API key is read from `st.session_state["GEMINI_API_KEY"]`.
  - If translation fails (e.g., no key or API error), the original text is shown and a warning is displayed.

## 4. Fallback Handling

- If no YouTube API key is provided, a hardcoded list of English-language fallback videos is shown.
- If no Gemini API key is set, the original (possibly non-English) YouTube description is used.

## 5. User Experience Flow

1. **User opens the app**
2. **Welcome page is shown:**
   - Patch analysis, patch videos, trending champions, and features grid are displayed.
   - Patch video descriptions are always in English if a Gemini API key is set.
3. **User can proceed to analysis by entering details and clicking the relevant buttons.**
