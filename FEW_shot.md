## 🎯 What is Few-Shot Learning?

**Few-shot learning** is a machine learning technique where a model learns to perform a task with only a few examples. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), it means providing the model with a small number of input-output examples to guide its responses.

### Key Concepts:
- **Zero-shot**: No examples provided (current implementation)
- **One-shot**: One example provided
- **Few-shot**: Multiple examples provided (2-5 typically)
- **Many-shot**: Many examples provided (10+)

---

## 🧠 Theory and Benefits

### How Few-Shot Learning Works

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The LLM identifies patterns in the provided examples
2. **Format Learning**: Understands the expected output structure
3. **Style Mimicking**: Adopts the tone and depth of analysis
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Learns domain-specific terminology and concepts

### Benefits for LoL Analysis

1. **Consistency**: Ensures similar analysis structure across all responses
2. **Quality**: Demonstrates the expected depth and detail level
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Shows LoL-specific terminology and concepts
4. **Format Adherence**: Guarantees proper JSON structure and field completion
5. **Reduced Hallucination**: Examples ground the model in realistic responses

    """Create prompt with few-shot examples"""
    
    base_prompt = get_base_system_prompt(analysis_type)
    
    # Add examples section
    examples_section = "Here are examples of excellent analysis:\n\n"
    
    for i, example in enumerate(examples, 1):
        examples_section += f"Example {i}:\n"
        examples_section += f"Input: {example['input']}\n"
        examples_section += f"Analysis: {json.dumps(example['output'], indent=2)}\n\n"
    
    examples_section += "Now analyze the following team composition following these examples:\n"
    
    return base_prompt + "\n\n" + examples_section

# Modified get_analysis function with few-shot learning
def get_analysis_with_few_shot(analysis_type, data):
    """Enhanced analysis with few-shot learning"""
    
    # Get API key
    api_key = st.session_state.get("OPENAI_API_KEY") or os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Example Selection Criteria

**Good Examples Should:**
- ✅ Represent diverse scenarios (early game, late game, teamfight, split push)
- ✅ Show proper JSON structure and field completion
- ✅ Demonstrate appropriate analysis depth
- ✅ Use correct LoL terminology
- ✅ Provide actionable insights

**Avoid Examples That:**
- ❌ Are too similar to each other
- ❌ Contain outdated information
- ❌ Have incomplete or malformed JSON
- ❌ Use generic or vague language
- ❌ Provide unrealistic assessments

### 2. Example Diversity

```python
# Ensure diverse examples across different team archetypes
DIVERSE_EXAMPLES = [
    # Teamfight composition
    {"input": "Malphite, Graves, Yasuo, Jinx, Leona", "archetype": "teamfight"},
    
    # Early game composition  
    {"input": "Fiora, Nidalee, LeBlanc, Lucian, Thresh", "archetype": "early_game"},
    
    # Poke composition
    {"input": "Jayce, Graves, Xerath, Ezreal, Karma", "archetype": "poke"},
    
    # Split push composition
    {"input": "Fiora, Graves, Twisted Fate, Jinx, Thresh", "archetype": "split_push"},
    
    # Protect the carry
    {"input": "Maokai, Sejuani, Lulu, Kog'Maw, Braum", "archetype": "protect_carry"}
]
```

### 3. Dynamic Example Selection

```python
def select_relevant_examples(team_composition: List[str], all_examples: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Select most relevant examples based on team composition"""
    
    # Analyze team archetype
    team_archetype = analyze_team_archetype(team_composition)
    
    # Select examples that match or complement the archetype
    relevant_examples = []
    
    for example in all_examples:
        if example.get("archetype") == team_archetype:
            relevant_examples.append(example)
        elif len(relevant_examples) < 2:  # Ensure minimum examples
            relevant_examples.append(example)
    
    return relevant_examples[:3]  # Limit to 3 examples for token efficiency
```

### 4. Example Quality Metrics

```python
def assess_example_quality(example: Dict) -> float:
    """Assess the quality of a few-shot example"""
    score = 0.0
    
    # Check completeness (40 points)
    required_fields = ["summary", "strengths", "weaknesses", "win_conditions"]
    completeness = sum(1 for field in required_fields if field in example["output"])
    score += (completeness / len(required_fields)) * 40
    
    # Check detail level (30 points)
    avg_length = sum(len(str(v)) for v in example["output"].values()) / len(example["output"])
    detail_score = min(avg_length / 100, 1.0) * 30  # Normalize to 100 chars
    score += detail_score
    
    # Check specificity (30 points)
    specific_terms = ["champion", "ability", "item", "objective", "teamfight"]
    content = json.dumps(example["output"]).lower()
    specificity = sum(1 for term in specific_terms if term in content)
    score += (specificity / len(specific_terms)) * 30
    
    return score

# Filter examples by quality
high_quality_examples = [
    example for example in all_examples 
    if assess_example_quality(example) > 70
]
```

---

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Token Usage Considerations

```python
def calculate_token_impact(examples: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Calculate token usage impact of few-shot examples"""
    
    # Estimate tokens (rough: 1 token ≈ 4 characters)
    total_chars = 0
    for example in examples:
        total_chars += len(json.dumps(example, indent=2))
    
    estimated_tokens = total_chars // 4
    
    return {
        "additional_tokens": estimated_tokens,
        "cost_increase_percent": (estimated_tokens / 1000) * 100,  # Rough estimate
        "recommended_max_examples": min(3, 2000 // (estimated_tokens // len(examples)))
    }
```

### Quality vs Cost Trade-off

| Examples | Token Increase | Quality Improvement | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 0 (Zero-shot) | 0% | Baseline | Current implementation |
| 1 (One-shot) | +15% | +25% | Good balance |
| 2-3 (Few-shot) | +30% | +45% | **Recommended** |
| 5+ (Many-shot) | +60% | +55% | Diminishing returns |

### Implementation Recommendation

```python
# Optimal implementation balancing quality and cost
OPTIMAL_FEW_SHOT_CONFIG = {
    "max_examples": 2,  # Sweet spot for quality/cost
    "max_tokens_per_example": 500,  # Prevent overly long examples
    "selection_strategy": "diverse_and_relevant",  # Dynamic selection
    "quality_threshold": 70  # Minimum quality score
}
```

# LangChain Explanation

This section explains how LangChain is used in this app to enable advanced question-answering and retrieval over your analysis data.

## Purpose

The utility functions in `langchain_utils.py` allow you to:
- Save analysis data to a file
- Create a conversational retrieval chain using LangChain, so users can ask questions about the analysis data with an LLM (like OpenAI's models)

## Key Functions

### `create_chat_chain(file_path: str)`
Creates a chat chain that can answer questions about the analysis data.

**Steps:**
1. Retrieves the OpenAI API key from Streamlit session state or environment variables.
2. Initializes OpenAI embeddings for text vectorization.
3. Loads analysis data from a JSON file.
4. Converts each section of the analysis data into a text chunk.
5. Uses FAISS to index these text chunks for efficient semantic search.
6. Sets up a ConversationalRetrievalChain with a ChatOpenAI model and the FAISS retriever.

**Code:**
```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
import json
import streamlit as st
import os

def create_chat_chain(file_path: str):
    """
    Create a chat chain that can answer questions about the analysis data
    """
    # Get API key from session state first, then environment
    api_key = st.session_state.get("OPENAI_API_KEY") or os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("OpenAI API key not found. Please set your API key in the sidebar.")
    
    # Initialize embeddings and vector store
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=api_key)
    
    # Load and process the analysis data
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        analysis_data = json.load(f)
    
    # Create text chunks from analysis data
    text_chunks = []
    for section, content in analysis_data.items():
        text_chunks.append(f"{section}: {json.dumps(content, indent=2)}")
        print(f"{section}: {json.dumps(content, indent=2)}")
    # Create vector store
    docsearch = FAISS.from_texts(text_chunks, embeddings)
    
    # Create chat chain
    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, openai_api_key=api_key)
    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
        llm=model,
        retriever=docsearch.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3}),
        return_source_documents=True
    )
    
    return qa
```

### `answer_question(qa_chain, question: str, chat_history: list)`
Gets an answer to a question using the chat chain.

**Code:**
```python
def answer_question(qa_chain, question: str, chat_history: list):
    """
    Get an answer to a question using the chat chain
    """
    result = qa_chain({
        "question": question,
        "chat_history": chat_history
    })
    return result
```

## Summary
- These utilities enable semantic search and Q&A over analysis data using LLMs and vector search.
- The approach leverages OpenAI embeddings and FAISS for efficient, context-aware retrieval.
- Users can interact with their analysis results in natural language, powered by LangChain.
