# Summary of Changes (2025-06-20)

This document summarizes all the major changes and improvements made to your LoL Pre-Game Analysis project today.

---

## 1. Enhanced Welcome Page
- The default welcome screen was replaced with an improved version that now displays:
  - The latest patch info and meta insights (AI-powered if Gemini API key is provided, fallback otherwise)
  - Featured patch videos
  - Trending champions
  - Analysis features grid
- This is now shown to the user on app start, before any analysis is performed.

## 2. Patch Videos: English-Only Descriptions
- The Patch Videos section was updated to ensure all video descriptions are always shown in English.
- The YouTube API call now sets `relevanceLanguage="en"` to prefer English videos and metadata.
- **Auto-translation:**
  - Every video description is now automatically translated to English using Gemini (if a Gemini API key is available).
  - This guarantees that even if YouTube returns non-English videos, users will only see English descriptions in the UI.

## 3. Dependency Management
- Installed the `google-generativeai` Python package to support Gemini-powered features.

## 4. Bug Fixes & Refactoring
- Fixed an issue where the enhanced welcome page was not being rendered by default (`render_enhanced_welcome` now called in `app.py`).
- Ensured all necessary imports are at the top of the main app file.
- Improved error handling for missing imports and dependencies.

## 5. API Key Configuration
- The app now expects the Gemini API key to be set in `.env` or via the sidebar for full AI-powered features (including translation).

## How to Use
1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **On first load:**
   - You will see the enhanced welcome page with patch insights, videos, and trending champions.
   - Video descriptions will always be in English (auto-translated if needed).
3. **For AI-powered features:**
   - Add your Gemini API key in the sidebar or `.env` file for best results.
